        <h3> WARNING: If you found this page somehow, do not play this game at the moment. There are severe camera issues I was not <br>
            aware of at the time of release. This will be fixed sometime in the future.</h3>

        <p>
            This is the first game I have ever released, and it was made from scratch in 3 days for Christmas. Unfortunately, there are many bugs and issues <br>
            that will not be fixed in the foreseen future.<br><br>
            You can download it on itch.io at <a href="https://calebkronstad.itch.io/a-cozy-christmas" target="_blank">https://calebkronstad.itch.io/a-cozy-christmas</a>.<br><br>
