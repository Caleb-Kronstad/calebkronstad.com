        <h1>A Cozy Christmas</h1>

        <p>
            I finally released my first game! I made it in 3 days in time for Christmas, so expect some bugs (Also because I made it in Unity haha...).<br>
            If you play it and you have any feedback feel free to share, but remember that I had to cut a lot of corners in order to get it out in 3 days.<br><br>
            You can download it on itch.io at <a href="https://calebkronstad.itch.io/a-cozy-christmas" target="_blank">https://calebkronstad.itch.io/a-cozy-christmas</a>.<br><br>
            I tried having a download link here but all the free things don't let me go over around 25mb and the game<br> 
            is 100mb so that's unfortunate (I'm not rich üòî).
